# Tol Barad When?

_Keep track of the next Tol Barad battle._

## How does Tol Barad When? work?

The AddOn works by grabbing Tol Barad information when it's available, storing its next start time (or if it's in progress), and setting up various alerts and prompts to help you collect Honor, Mounts, Pets, and Friends!

## Usage

You donâ€™t have to do anything special to get things working. By zoning into Tol Barad, the AddOn will collect all the information it needs. You can always check when the next battle is with the following command:

`/tbw`

If you want, you can also share the next start time with Party or Raid members:

`/tbw share`

## Special thanks

- All my good friends whom I see on a wonderfully-often basis, still, in Tol Barad.
